# CP
Intro: It's my 2nd sem running. In first sem, I did beginner level problem solving with c. Here I am trying to solve problems using c++. I solve most of the problems from codeforces.
Target: There is no specific target like need to become grand master in codeforces. Main focus is to build my brain to think clearly, improve implementation process via problem solving. I will try to solve at least one problem each day and spend 1H on theory part.
